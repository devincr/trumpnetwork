## Plotting Abramson's (2018) Trump-Russia Network

We are a group of political science PhD students at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill who set out to plot the network of relationships described in attorney and professor Seth Abramson's 2018 book *Proof of Collusion* by hand coding over 300 "nodes" (actors and organizations) and approximately 700 connections between them. Our aim was to see if constructing such a plot could be a useful tool to visualize the book's narrative and its over 300-person cast of characters. In so doing we hoped to also provide a useful tool to visualize and understand the political events and relationships leading up to and culiminating in the 2016 election. This website provides the results of this effort, i.e. the interactive dynamic and static network plots, and the data and code required to replicate the plots (links below). 

**Why *Proof of Collusion*?**

Of the many tell-all books available to choose from when we started this project in the fall of 2019, we chose Abramson's (2018) *Proof of Collusion* given its focus on the deeper roots of Donald Trump's connections to Russia. *Proof of Collusion* is based on all publicly available information on Trump's connections and interactions with Russian affiliates; primarily news stories and legal documents. As a data source, this provides us with a decades long account of Trumpâ€™s political and economic connections with Russians. Notably, this includes only those connections that have been reported and verified in the press and that Abramson included in his account, so the network we present is reliant on the accuracy and particular sample of those accounts. It should therefore not be considered a complete account of the network of relationships between Trump and Russian affiliates; rather it is limited to those described in the book.

### Dynamic network plot (1973-2019)

The dynamic network plot plays the evolution of relationships over time, beginning in 1973 and ending in 2019. 

The plot has several interactive features:
+ Clicking a node lets you view the name of the person and their country affiliation
+ Clicking a link between nodes lets you view text from the book about the relationship (with years of interaction and page numbers included).
+ Double clicking a node will keep the node highlighted and label as the plot plays

### Static network plots

The static network plots below show the same nodes and connections as in the dynamic plot but at particular time periods (as of 1990, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2019). The plots for particular time periods were created by subsetting the full network to only include the nodes/links in the network as of that particular year.

The plots have several interactive features, some additional to the dynamic plot:
+ Clicking on the nodes and links again provides information about the nodes/links
+ Selecting a node on the plot highlights that node and its closest connections
+ Selecting a node from the dropdown menu (alphabetized) will highlight that node and its closest connections
+ Nodes can be moved around for better visualization
