## Plotting Abramson's (2018) Trump-Russia Network

We are a group of political science PhD students at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill who set out to plot the network of relationships described in Seth Abramson's 2018 book *Proof of Collusion*. Our aim was to see if constructing such a plot could be a useful tool to visualize the book's narrative and its over 300 cast of characters. In so doing we hoped to also provide a useful tool to visualize and understand the political events and relationships leading up to and culiminating in the 2016 election. This website provides the results of this effort -- the interactive dynamic and static network plots at the links below -- and provides the data and code required to replicate the plots.
